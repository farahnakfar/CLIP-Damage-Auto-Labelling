# CLIP-Powered Automated Damage Labeling

**Automated clustering and damage detection labeling for industrial images powered by the CLIP model.**

This project provides a complete pipeline for analyzing industrial inspection images (power line towers, bolts, metal structures,...). It uses OpenAI's CLIP model to extract both visual and semantic features, performs clustering to group similar images, and automatically assigns descriptive labels to each group and image file.
